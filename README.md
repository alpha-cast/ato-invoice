Press `CTRL` to show all editable fields, and to get access to hidden edit controls for adding and removing line items. Also shows editable fields which have been collapsed because they have no content.

When you're done, just print it to get at your invoice.

Saves the most recent values to local store so you don't have to retype them every time.
